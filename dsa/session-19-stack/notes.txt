Stack is a linear data structure which follows LIFO principle
Last in First out

Stack always works in single direction.
add the element for same side and remove the element from same side

example: stack of books, stack of plates, stack of coins.

Add element on top (push)

Remove element from top (pop)

Logic : check if char is Num (isNaN(ch))
            yes --> push it in stack

            no then take 2 numbers using pop
            b= stack.pop()
            a= stack.pop()
            perform operation by using switch case get the result
            push the result again in stack
